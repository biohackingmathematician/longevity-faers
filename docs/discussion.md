# Results and Discussion

## Overview

This document presents the interpretation of adverse event signals identified through disproportionality analysis of FAERS data for longevity-relevant medications. Results represent signal detection (hypothesis generation) from a spontaneous reporting system and do not constitute medical advice or treatment recommendations.

**Methodological Note:** FAERS is a spontaneous reporting system with no exposure denominator. Results represent signal detection (hypothesis generation), NOT incidence rates, NOT causal claims, and NOT treatment recommendations. All analyses should be interpreted within this framework.

## Metformin: The Longevity Pioneer

### Benefits (Literature)
- Potential anti-aging effects (TAME trial pending)
- Improved insulin sensitivity
- Modest weight loss
- Cardiovascular protection in diabetes

### FAERS Signals
- **Elevated GI AEs:** Expected, well-documented (nausea, diarrhea)
- **Lactic acidosis signal:** Rare but serious (especially in renal impairment)
- **Low musculoskeletal signal:** Reassuring for training

### Performance Angle
- GI burden may affect training nutrition timing
- Lactic acidosis risk theoretically relevant for high-intensity exercise, but incidence extremely low in healthy individuals
- Minimal impact on muscle function

### Summary
Metformin shows expected GI side effects but reassuringly low musculoskeletal signals compared to statins, suggesting minimal impact on training capacity.

## Statins: Balancing CVD Protection and Myopathy Risk

### Benefits (Literature)
- Proven CVD risk reduction
- Mortality benefit in high-risk patients
- Pleiotropic effects beyond cholesterol lowering

### FAERS Signals
- **Elevated musculoskeletal AEs:** Myalgia, myopathy, rare rhabdomyolysis
- **Moderate metabolic signals:** New-onset diabetes risk
- **Low GI signals:** Generally well-tolerated GI-wise

### Performance Angle
- Myopathy may impair strength training and recovery
- CoQ10 co-supplementation sometimes mitigates muscle symptoms
- Critical consideration for strength athletes

### Summary
Statins exhibit the highest musculoskeletal AE signal among study drugs, consistent with known myopathy risk—a critical consideration for strength athletes.

## GLP-1 Agonists: Powerful Tools with GI Tradeoffs

### Benefits (Literature)
- Weight loss (STEP, SUSTAIN trials)
- Cardiovascular outcomes improvement
- Potential neuroprotection
- Metabolic benefits

### FAERS Signals
- **Dominant GI AEs:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (overwhelming signal)
- **Some pancreatitis signals:** Low absolute risk but notable
- **Emerging signals:** Possible thyroid signals (medullary cancer in rodents, human data unclear)

### Performance Angle
- Severe nausea may impair calorie intake for bulking
- Appetite suppression could hinder muscle gain
- May limit utility for athletes prioritizing muscle mass

### Summary
GLP-1 agonists show overwhelming GI burden in FAERS, which may limit utility for athletes prioritizing muscle mass, despite cardiometabolic benefits.

## SGLT2 Inhibitors: Cardiorenal Benefits, Keto Concerns

### Benefits (Literature)
- Cardioprotection (reduced heart failure)
- Renal protection (slows CKD progression)
- Modest weight loss
- Blood pressure reduction

### FAERS Signals
- **Moderate metabolic AEs:** DKA risk, especially with low-carb diets
- **Genitourinary infections:** Expected mechanism (glucose in urine)
- **Low musculoskeletal signals:** Favorable profile

### Performance Angle
- DKA risk elevated with ketogenic diets (common in bodybuilding)
- Hydration status critical (SGLT2i causes osmotic diuresis)
- Favorable muscle profile

### Summary
SGLT2 inhibitors show favorable musculoskeletal profile but notable DKA signal—caution needed in athletes using low-carb protocols.

## Implications for Optimization

### For Cardiovascular Health
- All four classes have evidence for cardiovascular benefits
- Statins carry highest muscle risk
- SGLT2i and GLP-1s show strong cardioprotection

### For Metabolic Health
- Metformin, GLP-1, SGLT2i all improve glucose/insulin
- Metformin has longest safety track record
- GLP-1s most potent for weight loss

### For Performance
- **Most muscle-friendly:** Metformin and SGLT2i
- **Challenging for muscle gain:** GLP-1s (appetite suppression)
- **Highest muscle risk:** Statins (myopathy)
- **Keto compatibility:** Metformin and statins safer than SGLT2i

## Limitations and Caveats

### Reporting Bias
- Serious AEs over-represented (mild issues not reported)
- Media attention can spike reports
- Manufacturer reporting requirements vary

### No Causality
- FAERS cannot establish causation
- Confounding by indication (diabetes drugs used in diabetic patients)
- Polypharmacy makes attribution difficult

### Missing Context
- No exposure denominator (cannot calculate rates)
- Missing data on dose, duration, indication
- Age/sex distributions differ by drug

### Generalizability
- FAERS represents reported AEs, not all AEs
- Healthy individuals may have different risk profiles
- Athletes may have unique considerations

## Final Note

This analysis identifies adverse event signals from spontaneous reporting data. It does not constitute medical advice. Decisions about medication use should be made with a qualified healthcare provider considering individual health status, risk factors, and goals.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate computational pharmacovigilance methods and provide data-driven insights into safety profiles, not to make treatment recommendations.
